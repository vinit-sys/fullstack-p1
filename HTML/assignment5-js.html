        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting
        language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many
        non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for
        Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript
        contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and
        a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and
        statements. History of JavaScript: It was created in 1995 by Brendan
        Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be
        named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the
        JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to
        run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the
        host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the
        outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.
