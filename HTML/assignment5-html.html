        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web
        pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and
        Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages.
        Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which
        defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate
        (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it
        and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages
        are human readable. Language uses tags to define what manipulation has
        to be done on the text. HTML is a markup language which is used by the
        browser to manipulate text, images and other content to display it in
        required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first
        ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0 but the first standard version was
        HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999.
