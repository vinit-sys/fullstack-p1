    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>
      Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
      practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
      Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
      challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and
      techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and
      so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
      developing.
